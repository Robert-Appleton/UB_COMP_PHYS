    "To practice the skills we have learned so far I want you to complete the following tasks to the best of your ability. For each problem I want a markdown cell that has the number of the problem you are solving, a brief description with what the problem is asking and a few sentences that explain how you plan to write the code. You do not need to have each problem in one code cell, use as many as necessary. Use comments in each line of the code cells to explain the commands being used. \n",

    "1. Create a folder for all the files that will be saved for this class. Name the folder something related to the title of this course. Inside that folder create 2 more folders one for in class notes and files from canvas. Take the time to move all the lecture files from canvas into the class notes folder.\n",
